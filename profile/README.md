# Practal â€” Practical Logic: Empowering Your Vision through Precision

Practal has its first monthly sponsor, many thanks to [purebounce](https://github.com/purebounce)! ðŸŽ‰

For background information on *Practal* and its vision, please check out [practal.com](https://practal.com).

Currently, only [me](https://github.com/phlegmaticprogrammer) is working on *Practal*. Hopefully that will change eventually! 
Before that can happen, I first need to firmly establish the roots of the project. Early research prototypes have been implemented in [Swift](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/), but in order to make Practal as widely available as possible, all development has been shifted to [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).

My goals for Practal have shifted throughout 2023/2024. I've made good progress with the theoretical side of Practal, 
*Abstraction Logic*, and I am working on a [book about Abstraction Logic](http://abstractionlogic.com) to document that.

## *Practal.com* and *Practal Desktop*

The *Practal.com* cloud app is the long-term and ultimate goal. Its purpose is to be a tool for [*Empowering Your Vision through Precision*](https://practal.com).
For the more technically minded, think of it as a tool for *Designing with Abstractions*.

If that still sounds too vague for you, imagine something of a fusion of interactive theorem proving systems like [Isabelle](https://isabelle.in.tum.de), with systems like [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org), word processing technologies inspired by LaTeX, [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), and AI capabilities inspired by systems such as [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt).

*Practal Desktop* is planned to be a version of Practal that runs locally on your desktop, independently from any cloud.

## *Practal Core*

*Practal Core* is planned to be an open-source library implementing fundamental algorithms and data structures of Practal,
for inclusion in your own software so that it can enjoy the same strong foundation as Practal does.

## *Practalium*

If Abstraction Logic is the best logic possible, would not a programming language based on it be the best programming language possible? Practalium is a project to find this out! If successful, Practalium code will make its way into building Practal alongside TypeScript.

## Funding

The Practal.com cloud app will be published under a Freemium business model based on subscriptions.  

The hope is that this enables sustained development and availability of resources, such that Practal can eventually become everyday infrastructure. 

To ensure that this infrastructure can be used without worrying about lock-in, core components of Practal are published as open-source projects. Please consider [sponsoring them](https://github.com/sponsors/practal?o=sd&sc=t)!
